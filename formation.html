                                        <h3>First of all, the way I imagine 2-4-3-1 is shown below:-</h3><br>
                                        <span class="image fit main"><img src="images/form.png" alt="" /></span><br>
                                        <h3>In such a formation, as we can see, the centre backs are sacrificed and pushed forward to defensive
                                            midfield. The midfield in this case pushes back upon attack from opposition. The two midfielders in 
                                            the two wings push forwards to occupy the position of the forward wingers while the two second strikers stay in position
                                            and become midfield. While attacking, the two defenders may mush forward along with the two wingers and the stricker such that
                                            the formation changes to a 4-3-3. 
                                        </h3>
                                        <h3>Now, let us indivisually look at the advantages and the disadvantages of this formation.
                                            <br>
                                            First of all, the biggest disadvantage of this formation is the lack of central defenders which is a risk.
                                            There might be negative consequences if the team does not fall back fast enough. For this, the wingers need to be
                                            faster than average while the stricker and the central block needs to have a good sense of positioning. The midfielders,
                                            especially the last layer of midfield needs to be physically strong and should be capable of assuming the role of a cetral defender
                                            whenever necessary. There can be lack of support for the goalkeeper too.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Coming to the advantage, this formation supports high speed passing. Every player has atleast 2 options avialable at any given time
                                            where an accuracy of above 90% is acheivable. Such an arrangement is good for build-up play but the lack of support for the goalkeeper
                                            makes passing in the defense risky. The defenders at the two ends should not pass to eachother or the goalkeeper unless in an emergency like
                                            an attack in or near the penalty box, when the two defenders will have to come closer. and be inside the box blocking any shots from the opposition.
                                            Rather, they should try to pass to the wingers near them and the defensive midfielders who can move the ball between both the flanks. The forward block is however 
                                            allowed to play long passes as long the passes do not cross the first line of midfield.
                                        </h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>
                                            It has to be noted though that such a formation is suitable for possession based game and the ball should be
                                            in control of the midfielders and should finish with them having the most touches. If the ball is lost in the central
                                            midfield, it would leave the defense at high risk and two defenders would have push towards the center to cover the attacking player.
                                            However, this would leave the two wings free of defense, which can easily be exploited with a slide in to one of the wingers who can go past
                                            the goalkeeper or score himself. A solution to this problem would be to have the midfield wingers mark the opposing team's wingers in case of
                                            such a scenario. There is also opportunity of creativity in the midfield.
                                            <br>

                                        <h3>As can be seen from the above image, the areas closer to centre of the pitch enjoy more possession,
                                            which is implicative of the fact that the midfielders are in control of the ball most of the time 
                                            and play a crucial role during build-up. Build-up is more from the centre than the wings due to less possession
                                            in the wings. Playing through the wings is difficult and risky in this formation as there are very few players to support
                                            the build-up. However, in the centre, there are several options as the concentration of players is a lot higher. Therefore it is 
                                            safer to build-up from the centre. The passes should be fast paced. The most viable option is passing to the midfielders as they lie closer to
                                            all players in the team and yields less chances of mispasses.

                                            Concluding the article, the formation supports creativity and offers a balance between attack and defense.
                                            which however heavily relies on the defenders ability to keep the ball out of the danger zone which in this formation
                                            is bigger than usual due to lack of defenders. It includes the entire penalty box and the space beyond it till the second midfield line-up. 
                                            The safe zone is the area covered by the two midfield line-ups. This doesnot include the wingers or the stricker. A team using this formation must
                                            practice high speed passing and improve the player's decision making and precision, especially the midfield. A faulty midfield would crumble the entire formation.
