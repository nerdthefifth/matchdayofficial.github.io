                                        <h3>Strikers are like superheroes in the game of soccer. 
                                            They make the fans jump up in joy every time they find the back of the net or 
                                            fall to their knees in despair every time they fail to convert a golden opportunity. 
                                            Every striker scores wonderful goals and misses some pretty easy chances. 
                                            But the question is — how do we know who is a better striker? Is it their scoring 
                                            ability, their ninja-like reflexes, or their lightning-fast pace? Read on to find out.</h3><br>

                                        <h2><b>So how do we proceed to rate a striker?</b>
                                        </h2>
                                        <h3>To rate something, we need some variables or factors based on which we can come
                                             to a conclusion. In the case of strikers in soccer, there are 5 major factors 
                                             that define their abilities.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            
                                            • The striker’s scoring ability is one 
                                            of the first things that come to one’s mind when
                                             rating strikers. It is a measure of how productive a
                                              striker has been since the primary task of a striker is
                                               to score goals. We can find out his goal-scoring efficiency
                                                by using a simple formula:
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                (GS - xG)/xG * 100
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                In this formula, ‘GS’ represents goals scored by the player,
                                                 ‘xG’ represents the cumulative expected goals (the measure of 
                                                 the probability of a shot resulting in a goal based on distance from
                                                  goal, angle and position, type of shot, build up to the shot and pressure 
                                                  from the defenders). The resultant percentage obtained after plugging in the 
                                                  values will give us the efficiency of the striker. A percentage value below 100% 
                                                  indicates that the striker is underperforming and vice versa. We can take 
                                                  two players and compare their respective percentages to conclude who is a better
                                                   goal-scorer.

                                                   <br>
                                                   <br>

                                                However, suppose a player who played 90 minutes of 15 matches scored more goals 
                                                than a player who played 20 minutes of 12 matches. The comparison of such a pair of
                                                 players would be unfair and inaccurate. Hence another factor can be implemented into
                                                  the formula, which is the number of minutes played.
                                            <br>
                                           

                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            • A striker’s physical attributes play an important role in providing 
                                            that extra edge. Nowadays, teams choose defenders who have a good build, great 
                                            jumping ability, and good pace. To cope with such players, a striker needs to have 
                                            the necessary physical prowess. He should possess strength, speed, agility, and endurance.
                                            <br><br>    
                                            The lower body muscles are required to be well-developed for better sprinting, 
                                            jumping, and shooting. The quadriceps located in front of the thigh are responsible 
                                            for extending the knee joint and are needed for generating power in the lower leg. 
                                            The hamstrings located at the back of the thigh aid in running and sprinting. 
                                            The glutes are responsible for hip extension and are required for acceleration. 
                                            The calf muscles in the lower leg are required to gain momentum by pushing against 
                                            the ground which is useful in jumping and sprinting. Apart from the lower leg muscles, 
                                            a strong core muscle, particularly rectus abdominis, obliques, and lower back muscles
                                             aid in maintaining balance and stability while shooting, dribbling, or changing directions.
                                              Upper body strength in the shoulders, chest, and back is required for holding off
                                               defenders and shielding the ball from opponents.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Suggested exercises for strikers include agility ladder drills which improve 
                                            footwork, agility coordination between muscles, and balance. It involves stepping 
                                            into a square with one foot and then stepping out after about 5 seconds and doing the
                                             same with the other foot. Deadlifts improve the lower body muscles such as the glutes, 
                                             hamstrings, and lower back. Attaching a resistance band to a stationary object, wrapping
                                              the other end around the waist, and running against the resistance of the band as fast 
                                              as possible is another exercise to improve lower body muscles. Single-legged squats 
                                              improve the general body balance, which can be useful during dribbling scenarios. 
                                              Planks improve core strength and sprints improve endurance.

                                                Technical skill refers to the ability to control and manipulate 
                                                the ball with precision and finesse. Dribbling, shooting, passing, 
                                                and first touch, all require technical skill.
                                            <br><br>
                                                The technical skill of an individual can be marked by assigning a score to 
                                                each skill move. Every move can be graded from 1 to 10 based on factors like
                                                 distance and time the player performed the skill, the effectiveness of the 
                                                 skill (which reflects the decision-making abilities of the player), and the 
                                                 number of players attacking the player during the since the beginning of the 
                                                 skill move till its end or the pressure exerted on the ball. The calmer a player
                                                  can be under pressure the better he is. Another factor is the success of the skill 
                                                  moves which can be rated from 0% to 100%. For example, 0% for a pass would indicate 
                                                  a terrible pass directly to an opposing player or within the opponent’s reach 
                                                  such that he didn't have to apply much effort. 50% success on a pass would indicate 
                                                  that the pass was not traveling in the direction the player wanted it to and was
                                                   collected by an opponent player but not very easily (maybe he had to run some 
                                                   distance to collect it).

                                            • Tactical awareness is the ability of a player to read the game. 
                                            The better a player reads a game, the better he/she can anticipate 
                                            player movements and position himself/herself in the right place to receive
                                             the ball and create scoring opportunities. Thomas Muller is a good example of 
                                             a player with commendable awareness.

                                            An important factor is off-the-ball runs (running without the ball in feet).
                                             We can measure the effectiveness of these runs by dividing the number of runs 
                                             made by the number of favored consequences (assists or goals or passes leading to goals).
                                              This can be divided by the number of minutes played to bring in consistency as a factor.
                                               Another factor that can be used is the space or area available to the player post the 
                                               movement subtracted from the space available before the movement.

                                            Link-up play is the ability of a player to communicate and combine 
                                            effectively with his/her teammates. Passing accuracy, time the player holds 
                                            the ball, number of teammates brought into play by the player, and movement to 
                                            create scoring opportunities are all factors in rating link-up play.

                                            • Attitude is a very important factor when rating players. It is my 
                                            belief that attitude reflects in work and has an impact on the surrounding 
                                            environment. I like players who are calm and composed when faced with adversities
                                             but passionate about the sport and have a high work rate (for a striker higher 
                                             chances created, higher chances converted, and greater distance run). Players 
                                             should have a positive attitude and should not criticize teammates, but rather 
                                             encourage them. They should be regular to practice, diligent and obedient, and 
                                             respectful to coaches and other players or faculty and even to opponents. A player 
                                             should have a positive impact on the team (increase the general happiness or not 
                                             decrease it). The player should not be lethargic or distracted.

                                            The work of evaluating a striker’s effectiveness is intricate 
                                            and multifaceted, necessitating an all-encompassing strategy. There a
                                            re several things to take into account when ranking a striker,
                                             from measuring their scoring potential and physical qualities to 
                                             technical abilities and tactical awareness to appraising their attitude and work rate.

                                            Statistical analysis, expert opinion, and video analysis may all be used to create 
                                            a striker rating system that is more objective and precise. Coaches and scouts may 
                                            use this to find talent, viewers can enjoy the game more, and players can utilize it
                                             to elevate their own play.
